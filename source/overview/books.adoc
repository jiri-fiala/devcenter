            <h3>Understanding PaaS</h3>
            <p class="small">Jan 24, 2012<br>by Michael P. McGrath</p>
            <p>The least understood feature of cloud computing, Platform as a Service (PaaS), is also the most powerful and cost effective. This concise overview shows you why organizations that properly wield PaaS can quickly gain a strong competitive advantage. You'll learn how PaaS enables developers to pursue low cost R&D projects, lets system administrators focus on systems rather than servers, and helps architects evaluate new technology quickly and directly.</p>
