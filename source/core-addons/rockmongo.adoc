link:http://rockmongo.com/[RockMongo] is an open source MongoDB administration tool written in PHP, similarly to the phpMyAdmin, intended to handle administration of your MongoDB databases, collections and documents via a web user interface. RockMongo can be used for common database tasks, e.g. creating databases and collections, inserting, updating and deleting documents, querying the data and managing user roles.


== Installation
The RockMongo add-on can be installed using the following command:
[source,console]
--
$rhc cartridge add rockmongo -a <appname>
--
NOTE: You must have link:/databases/mongodb.html[the MongoDB cartridge] already installed in order to add this cartridge.

TIP: You can not install this add-on into a *scalable* application. Consider link:managing-port-forwarding.html[port forwarding] in order to use a local database management software of your choice as an alternative.

[source,console]

$rhc cartridge add rockmongo -a myapp
