All applications on the *Free Plan* are created on gears within the `us-east-1` Amazon EC2 region. *Bronze* and *Silver* plans also allow the hosting of applications in the `eu-west-1` Amazon EC2 region. link:https://www.openshift.com/dedicatednode[*Dedicated Node Services*] offer the ability to host applications in any Amazon EC2 region.

NOTE: Only applications using *Small.highcpu*, *Medium*, or *Large* gears can use additional regions. Small gears can only be created within the `us-east-1` AWS EC2 region.

IMPORTANT: OpenShift Online premium plan support is currently available to customers with a billing address in the *United States*, *Canada*, *Russia*, *Israel*, or *Europe* (*EU member states*, *Iceland*, *Norway*, and *Switzerland*). link:https://www.openshift.com/dedicatednode[Dedicated Node Services] are available for purchase worldwide.

=== Command Line Tools (RHC)
To view available regions or create an application using a specific region, you can use the OpenShift RHC Command Line Tools (rhc). If you haven't set up RHC, please visit the link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[installation guide] first and make sure your version is up to date with the following command:
[source]
----
$ sudo gem update rhc
----

=== Listing Available Regions and Zones
The `region` command is used to list and manage regions and zones.

To list all available regions and zones, use the following command:
[source]
----
$ rhc region list
----

TIP: You can also list available regions using the `rhc regions` command.

To see where an existing application is being hosting, use the following command:

[source]
----
$ rhc app show --gears -a <name>
----

=== Creating an Application in a Specific Region or Zone
If you have a Bronze or Silver account, you can create an application with Small.highcpu, Medium, or Large gears in a region other than `us-east-1` using the `--region` option:

[source]
----
$ rhc create-app <name> <cartridge> --gear-size <size> --region <region> --scaling
----

For example:

[source]
----
$ rhc create-app racer php-5.4 --gear-size medium --region aws-eu-west-1a --scaling
----

TIP: `create-app` is the same as `app create`.

=== Migrating an Existing Application to Another Region or Zone
The following command will let you migrate an existing app to a different region or zone by creating a copy of your application:

[source]
----
$ rhc create-app <new app name> --from-app <existing app name> --region <region>
----

=== Hosting an Application across Specific Regions or Zones
While OpenShift Online does not directly support multi-region hosting for a single application, it is possible to configure two identical applications to take advantage of multi-region hosting.

IMPORTANT: Using this method requires a Bronze or Silver Plan, along with a shared database service and knowledge of DNS configuration.

==== Step 1: Create two separate identical applications
Create the first application in Amazon `us-east` - this is the default region.

Create the second application in Amazon `eu-west` using the `region` option. For example:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create <app name> <cartridge> --gear-size <size> --region <region> --scaling
--

You can also use the `--from-app` flag to copy an existing application:

[source]
--
$ rhc create-app <new app name> --from-app <existing app name> --region <region>
--

==== Step 2: Configure a shared external database
Both applications need to be configured to use the same external database or database service, such as link:https://mongolab.com/[MongoLab] or link:/databases/amazon-rds.html[Amazon RDS].

==== Step 3: Configure DNS
Finally, you'll need your DNS provider to manage geoIP or load balancing between your two OpenShift application domains. In addition, you'll want your DNS provider to be able to detect failures.
