All OpenShift Online plans offer 3 free small gears (512MB RAM and 1GB disk space each). Larger gears and additional storage are available on both the *Bronze* and *Silver* plans. The premium plans also allow access to additional gears beyond the 3 free small gears provided to all users.

[[additional-gear-sizes]]
=== Additonal Gear Sizes
OpenShift currently offers four gear sizes that can be selected at the time an application is created. For all OpenShift users, 3 small gears are available for free. Premium plan customers have access to larger gear sizes and to more gears, allowing the creation of more applications and the ability to scale those applications based on usage.

The following gear prices are in USD.

|===

| *Small* | $0.02/hr (4 or more) | 512MB RAM
| *Small.highcpu* | $0.025/hr | 512MB RAM
| *Medium* | $0.05/hr | 1GB RAM
| *Large* | $0.10/hr | 2GB RAM

|===

You can define the gear size of an application during creation through either the web console or the command line tools.

==== Web Console

In the web console, you can choose the gear size from the *Gears* dropdown:

==== Command Line (rhc)

You can also define gear size when creating an application using the command line (rhc):

[source]
----
$ rhc app create mediumgearexample php-5.4 --gear-size medium
----

or

[source]
----
$ rhc app create mediumgearexample php-5.4 --g medium

[[additional-gear-storage]]
=== Additional Gear Storage

For Free plan users, each small gear has 1GB of storage, which is not expandable. Silver Plan users can expand all gears to 6GB of storage per gear at no additional cost. Bronze and Silver users may add more storage to any gear at a rate of $1.00 / GB / month, up to 30GB per gear.

TIP: Application storage size can be changed through either the web console or the command line tools.

==== Web Console

In the web console, first click on the existing storage amount for the application catridge you want to change:

Next, select the amount of additional storage you would like to set for *all gears of the specified  application cartridge*.

==== Command Line (rhc)

With the command line, you can `--add`, `--set`, or `--remove` additional storage for your applications. You can also view the existing storage allocated to an application:

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge storage --show -a <app_name>
----

*To set storage:*

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge storage php-5 -a <app_name> --set <Storage_Amount(GB)>
----

For example:

[source]
----
$ rhc cartridge storage php-5 -a racer --set 5gb
