Want a Dancer application backed by MySQL? Or maybe you're looking for Mojolicious and MongoDB? OpenShift Online currently supports `Perl 5.10`.

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language. With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Perl applications using your favorite frameworks and databases.

== Simplify Your Perl Deployments

Getting a Perl app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp perl-5.10
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your gear and install and configure Perl, MySQL, and a git repository. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/

== The Perl Cartridge
The `perl` cartridge provides http://www.perl.org/[Perl] on OpenShift.

=== Template Repository Layout
[source]
--
index.pl
.openshift/           Location for OpenShift specific files
    action_hooks/     See the Action Hooks documentation <1>
    markers/          See the Markers section below
    cpan.txt          List of modules to install
--
<1> link:/managing-your-applications/action-hooks.html[Action Hooks] documentation

Due to changes in Perl cartridge template layout, the application root is now stored in `$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR`, but is also backward compatible with deprecated `perl/` directory.

Modules are installed with `cpan.txt`, located in the `.openshift/` directory. In addition, application dependencies can be installed using cpanfile or Makefile.PL placed in the .openshift/ folder. deplist.txt is deprecated in favor of .openshift/cpan.txt.

=== Cartridge Layout
[source]
--
run/                  Various run configs (like httpd pid)
usr/                  Perl example application template
env/                  Environment variables
logs/                 Log data (like httpd access/error logs)
lib/                  Various libraries
bin/setup             The script to setup the cartridge
bin/build             Default build script
bin/teardown          Called at cartridge destruction
bin/control           Init script to start/stop httpd
versions/             Version data to support multiple perl versions (copied into place by setup)
--

=== Markers
Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Marker |Effect

|force_clean_build
|Will remove all previous perl deps and start installing required deps from scratch

|enable_cpan_tests
|Will install all the cpan packages and run their tests

|hot_deploy
|Will prevent the apache process from being restarted during build/deployment

|disable_auto_scaling
|Will prevent scalable applications from scaling up or down according to application load.

|enable_public_server_status
|Will enable server-status application path to be publicly available.
