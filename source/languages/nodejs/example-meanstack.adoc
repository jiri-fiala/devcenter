[float]
The MEAN stack is a potent new concoction of javascript-flavored tooling, services, and frameworks that make modern, single-page application design a breeze:

Just like the classic link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29[LAMP stack], the MEAN stack is not an official standard or vendor-specific product.  Both stacks simply represent a loose collection of best-of-breed open source solutions that can be easily customized, reconfigured, and replaced as needed.  In fact, as LAMP became more popular and it's related community grew, the "**P**" which originally just stood for **Perl** was redefined and expanded to represent **PHP** and **Python** as well.

== Getting Started
This guide uses *Yeoman* and the `angular-fullstack-generator` to set up your development environment.  The folks at link:http://learn.mean.io/#mean-io-hosting-mean-openshift[MEAN.io] also provide a nice distribution of MEAN that will run well on OpenShift.

[source, console]
----
$ npm install -g grunt grunt-cli bower yo generator-angular-fullstack
----

You'll also need access to the `git` command-line tools, and a MongoDB datastore - which can be link:http://www.mongodb.org/downloads[installed locally], provided as-a-service (see link:https://mongolab.com/[MongoLab] or link:https://www.mongohq.com/[MongoHQ]), or made available via link:https://www.openshift.com/blogs/set-up-local-access-to-openshift-hosted-services-with-port-forwarding[port-forwarding].  This particular distribution of the MEAN stack is configured to look for a local installation of MongoDB when started in a development mode.

Scaffold up a new MEAN stack application with link:https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-24-yeoman-ember-the-missing-tutorial[Yeoman] ("Yo", for short) and the `angular-fullstack` generator:

[source, console]
----
$ yo angular-fullstack YOUR_APP_NAME
----

When prompted, answer "yes" to every available option except Sass & Compass support.

Now that your development environment is ready to go, initialize your remotely-hosted OpenShift environment:

[source, console]
----
$ yo angular-fullstack:openshift OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME
----

This command can be run multiple times in order to setup additional OpenShift hosting environments if your OpenShift account has sufficient capacity.

[[develop]]
== link:https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-5-gruntjs-let-someone-else-do-my-tedious-repetitive-tasks[image:https://www.openshift.com/sites/default/files/grunt_logo.gif[float="right", width="100px", title="Grunt"]] 2. Develop

link:https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-5-gruntjs-let-someone-else-do-my-tedious-repetitive-tasks[Grunt] provides a nice set of tools for assisting with dev task automation.  It includes livereload support for refreshing connected browsers during development - ***link:https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-7-gruntjs-livereload-take-productivity-to-the-next-level[No need to reload the page!]***

Run `grunt serve` to give it a try:

[source, console]
----
$ grunt serve
----

It's usually a good idea to store your resulting project source in a version control system.  Feel free to add your own top-level git repository by running `git init` at the root of your project.  GitHub, or similar hosting accomodations can be used at this level, to help facilitate source code collaboration.

[[deploy]]
== link:https://www.openshift.com/blogs/10-reasons-openshift-is-the-best-place-to-host-your-nodejs-app#git[image:https://www.openshift.com/sites/default/files/git-logo.jpg[float="right", width="100px", title="Git"]] 3. Deploy

The initial setup should create a secondary git repository to track of the project's build results, where client-side sources are combined, minified, and optimised for production use.

Generate a new **build** of your application in your project's `dist` folder:

[source, console]
----
$ grunt build
----

Include a brief note about this release as you`add` and `commit` the new build for deployment:

[source, console]
----
$ cd dist
$ git commit -am "Launching our first BETA release - Ship it!"
----

Finally, use `git push` to send the release to your remote OpenShift hosting environment:

[source, console]
----
$ git push openshift master
----

LAMP stack afficianados should pause and take note: Your old stack probably never included a build / optimization process, or a complete development workflow.

[[scale]]
== 4. Scale

Scaling the MEAN stack on OpenShift is easy - especially when working with the `angular-fullstack` generator, which enables scaling by default during the earlier `yo angular-fullstack:openshift` step.

You can check your application's current list of container environments (or gears) with the following command:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc app show OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME --gears
----

The command output should include one front-end environment for running nodejs, and a back-end environment for MongoDB.

Scale up your front-end by adding a second instance to your application cluster:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc app scale-up OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME
----

Scaling limits can be set via the command line:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc cartridge scale nodejs -a OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME --min=2 --max=5
----

Or, in the OpenShift web console:

OpenShift Online's free plan includes support for running up to three containers concurrently. You can increase your account's capacity by link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/plan[upgrading to OpenShift Online's Silver or Bronze plans].
